<h1>Egusi Soup</h1>
<p><strong>Egusi Soup is a rich and hearty West African soup made with ground melon seeds, leafy vegetables, and assorted meats or fish. Widely enjoyed across Nigeria, this flavorful soup is known for its thick texture and nutty taste. Often cooked with palm oil, stockfish, crayfish, and seasoning, Egusi is typically served with pounded yam, eba, or fufu, making it a staple in Nigerian homes and festive occasions.</strong></p>

    <li>Adjust seasoning if necessary, then serve hot with pounded yam, eba, or fufu.</li>

<h2><u>Additional Information</u></h2>
<p><i>For a richer, more aromatic flavor, consider lightly toasting the egusi seeds before grinding them. If you enjoy a bit of heat and depth, blend in some fresh peppers (like scotch bonnet, bell pepper, and onion) and add them during the frying stage. When frying the egusi paste, avoid constant stirringâ€”let it cook undisturbed for a few minutes to develop a desirable, chunky texture. Soaking stockfish in warm water beforehand helps soften it and remove any grit or excess salt. Be sure to use high-quality red palm oil, as it significantly enhances the taste and color of the soup. Finally, the type of vegetable you use affects the flavor: bitterleaf adds a traditional, slightly bitter edge, while spinach or ugu offers a milder, more neutral taste.</i></p>
